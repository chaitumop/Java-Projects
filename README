System.out.print ("Hello, World!") 
These are my first examples on my quest to learn the Java programming language. This git will be filled with simple programs (that will hopefully later evolve into complex programs that have an actually purpose, or even an android app :D). Take a look at them, if you would like to use any of the programs, feel free, just please add credit where it's due.
